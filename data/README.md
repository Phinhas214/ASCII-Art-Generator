This was mostly an exploratory project, as I didn't have a definitive artistic intent in mind before I started the project besides
the fact that I wanted to explore ASCII art as a medium of expression. As the project matured I realized I decided to try out a 
photography of Gordon Parks, a civil rights activist photographer/director. This made me realize that there's not a lot of material
out there that modernizes these pieces that carry black people's stories from the civil rights era in the digital sphere. 
So this made it jarring at first when I saw the results of ASCII art of photographs that tell stories of black people during the civil 
rights era, not because it was bad but because it was an unexplored artistic space with lots of potential. I spent some time tweaking a
lot of the parameters, but I finally hoem something that I'm happy to share as a project.
